## Introduction

Parking Compass is a location-based Android application that allows the user to specify the location where they have parked their car and find it later using a real-time compass or a map. It also connects to [Parse](https://parse.com/) to save a backup of the previous places where the user has parked.


## Usage

To make the app run modify the file ids.xml (in app/src/main/res/values/) following the links provided there.
